These collection of files describe prediction of microscopic energy consumption of diesel vehicle in model year of 1998.

The details of the files are this.

* [microDieselMY1998.ipynb](microDieselMY1998.ipynb) is the model prepration and training notebook
* [diesel_MY1998.model](diesel_MY1998.model) is the saved model file
* [DieselMY1998_demonstration.ipynb](DieselMY1998_demonstration.ipynb) is the demonstration file that shows how to use the model for this vehicle class with a given driving profile.
* [DrivingPatterns](https://github.com/smarttransit-ai/micro-energy-prediction/tree/main/Diesel%20MY%202014/DrivingPatterns) is the folder containing samples of different driving patterns at peak hour and off-peak hour in each season.
