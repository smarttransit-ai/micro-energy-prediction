These collection of files describe prediction of microscopic energy consumption of electric vehicle in model year of 2016.

The details of the files are this.

* [microElectricMY2016.ipynb](microElectricMY2016.ipynb) is the model prepration and training notebook
* [electric_MY2016.model](electric_MY2016.model) is the saved model file
* [ElectricMY2016_demonstration.ipynb](ElectricMY2016_demonstration.ipynb) is the demonstration file that shows how to use the model for this vehicle class with a given driving profile.
* [DrivingPatterns](https://github.com/smarttransit-ai/micro-energy-prediction/tree/main/Electric%20MY%202016/DrivingPatterns) is the folder containing samples of different driving patterns at peak hour and off-peak hour in each season.
