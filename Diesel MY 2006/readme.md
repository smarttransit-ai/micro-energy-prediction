These collection of files describe prediction of microscopic energy consumption of diesel vehicle in model year of 2006.

The details of the files are this.

* [microDieselMY2006.ipynb](microDieselMY2006.ipynb) is the model prepration and training notebook
* [diesel_MY2006.model](diesel_MY2006.model) is the saved model file
* [DieselMY2006_demonstration.ipynb](DieselMY2006_demonstration.ipynb) is the demonstration file that shows how to use the model for this vehicle class with a given driving profile.
* [DrivingPatterns](https://github.com/smarttransit-ai/micro-energy-prediction/tree/main/Diesel%20MY%202006/DrivingPatterns) is the folder containing samples of different driving patterns at peak hour and off-peak hour in each season.
