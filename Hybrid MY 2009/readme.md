These collection of files describe prediction of microscopic energy consumption of hybrid vehicle in model year of 2009.

The details of the files are this.

* [microHybridMY2009.ipynb](microHybridMY2009.ipynb) is the model prepration and training notebook
* [hybrid_MY2009.model](hybrid_MY2009.model) is the saved model file
* [HybridMY2009_demonstration.ipynb](HybridMY2009_demonstration.ipynb) is the demonstration file that shows how to use the model for this vehicle class with a given driving profile.
* [DrivingPatterns](https://github.com/smarttransit-ai/micro-energy-prediction/tree/main/Hybrid%20MY%202009/DrivingPatterns) is the folder containing samples of different driving patterns at peak hour and off-peak hour in each season.
